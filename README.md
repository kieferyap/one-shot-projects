# One Shot Projects

Just a medley of all my quick projects and experiments for fun.
The rule is that they must be completed in 1 to 10 commits.

-----------------------

## Basic Budget
- **Language**: C
- **Description**: A very lightweight expense-logging application, which outputs in CSV format. I did this while I wait for [Budget Bunny](https://github.com/kieferyap/budget-bunny) to be completed.

## Lottery
- **Language**: Python
- **Description**: 
	- Reads lottery data and constructs an adjacency matrix containing only weights that are significant.
	- Constructs an undirected weighted graph based on the adjacency matrix
	- Displays the constructed graph
	- Detects cycles with specified lengths
	- Accepts a bet and calculates odds of winning by running through past data.
